ðŸ©º Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning
This project is a machine learning-based solution for predicting whether a person is likely to have diabetes, using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and an optional web interface.

ðŸ“š Dataset
Source: Pima Indians Diabetes Database (available on Kaggle)

Features include: Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function, and Age

Target: Outcome (0 = Non-diabetic, 1 = Diabetic)

ðŸ§  Models Used
Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

ðŸ“Š Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1 Score

Confusion Matrix

ðŸ’¡ Project Highlights
Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

Multiple ML models for comparison

Evaluation and performance metrics
